# Oh, you're checking me out?
Hello! Welcome to my github. This specific repository is where my [static curriculum site lives](slimecatdev.com). I'm a software engineer with backgrounds in Music, QA and Game Development.

## Why Slime Cat?
Short story shorter, I felt like I needed an image for an online precense that isn't my default nickname (Kiroto), and I stuck with a Cat made out of Slime. I started using it for Itch, and now I'm using it as a more official online-programmer side of things.

... But it's just that, a public image name.

## Any other plans for the site?
I'm going to list them here:
* Add more demos for other languages and skills.
* Redesign to have my timeline as the main focus of the site (whilst keeping the rest of the features).
